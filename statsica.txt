Data Analytics Report Structure:

	A. Original Question: What is the effect of Activity, Age, Height, Income and Sex on Weight?

	B. Description of Report

	C. Features Description: 
		1. Age - Continuous - Biological predictor
		2. Height - Continious - Biological predictor
		3. Income - Continuous - Lifestyle predictor
		4. Sex - Discrete/Categorical - Biological predictor
		5. Activity - Continuous - Lifestyle predictor
		6. Weight - Continuous - RESPONSE

	D. Aims: In order to test the effects of the predictors, we are going to build up to a multiple regressional model for this dataset. In order to do this, we first need to ask some preliminary questions to determine if our data is fit for making a model. 

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	E. Preliminary Analysis:
		1. Summary statistics of continuous variables in dataset - mean,median,std etc
		2. Distributions via histograms
		3. Gender - number of males and number of females

	F. What would I want to know about the ages/heights?
		1. Any variation or bias between genders? Violin plots
		2. Is there a significant difference between age/height of males and females? ANOVA or 2-sample t-test

	G. What would I want to know about the incomes?
		1. Income distribution between genders? violin plot or histogram?
		2. Is there a significant difference between male and female income in the study? ANOVA or 2 sample t-test
		3. Is there a relationship between income and activity?

	H. Correlation (R) analysis between each predictor with weight.

	I. Development of Machine Learning Linear Regression Algorithm:
		- Training: Test Dataset => 80/20 split
		- Train model
		- Present coefficients
		- Testing model on test dataset
		- Scoring model using R^2 
		- Residual Analysis, Confidence Intervals, P-values, SE of coefficients and error terms etc
